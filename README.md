# AutoDrive — GP AutoDrive bring-up runbook

A self-contained implementation of the GP (Oxbo) AutoDrive CAN protocol, plus a
**step-by-step commissioning procedure** for a real machine. You run the scripts
**in order**; each step has a **PASS gate**. *Do not move to the next step until
the current one passes.* If a step fails, fix the cause (each step lists the
usual ones) and re-run that same step.

This folder has no external dependencies beyond `python-can`. The route comes
from a **GeoJSON `LineString`** — [`line.geojson`](line.geojson) (a straight
path) and [`u_field.geojson`](u_field.geojson) (a U-shaped path with a turn) ship
as the two test routes; [`routes.py`](routes.py) resamples them to ~0.5 m and
flags the headland turn. Drop in your own GeoJSON line to drive a real field. The
byte reference for everything is **[PROTOCOL.md](PROTOCOL.md)**; the protocol code
is in **[`autodrive.py`](autodrive.py)**.

> ⚠️ **SAFETY.** Steps 1–8 are passive or only transmit data — the machine does
> not move. **In steps 9–10 the machine steers itself** once it is on the line.
> Per the field checklist ([`spec/spec2.md`](spec/spec2.md)) the **RunCommand
> does nothing yet** on the real machine — *you* push the joystick forward (1–2
> kph) and AutoDrive only takes over the **steering**. From step 9 on: clear the
> area, keep a hand on the e-stop, and have a second person watching. (On the
> bench the simulator drives the virtual machine for you, so the loop still runs
> end to end.)

## One switch: `CAN_BUS`

Every script reads the SocketCAN interface from the `CAN_BUS` environment
variable. That is the only thing that changes between bench and machine:

```sh
export CAN_BUS=vcan0     # bench test (virtual bus + the simulator)
export CAN_BUS=can0      # the real machine
```

Default if unset: `vcan0`.

---

## REST API

`api_server.py` passively listens to the CAN bus and exposes the latest decoded
machine state as JSON. It does **not** activate AutoDrive or send run commands.

```sh
export CAN_BUS=can0
./api_server.py
```

By default it binds to `0.0.0.0:8080`, so another computer on the same network can
query it with the machine computer's IP address:

```sh
curl http://MACHINE_IP:8080/state
curl http://MACHINE_IP:8080/position
curl http://MACHINE_IP:8080/anchorpoint
curl http://MACHINE_IP:8080/status
curl http://MACHINE_IP:8080/health
```

Useful options:

```sh
./api_server.py --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080 --can-bus can0
./api_server.py --can-bus vcan0   # bench test with simulator.py
```

The `/state` endpoint returns position, anchor point, status bits, CAN bus name,
frame count, last PGN, last receive age, and whether live CAN traffic is currently
fresh.

To log all CAN traffic continuously to hourly files:

```sh
./hourly_can_logger.py /var/log/autodrive-can --can-bus can0
```

It writes candump-style files named like `can0_20260616_1400.log`, rotating at the
top of each hour.

To visualize the REST API feed in Rerun:

```sh
./rerun_consumer.py
./rerun_consumer.py --api http://172.30.0.137:8080/state
./rerun_consumer.py --trail-seconds 1800
./rerun_consumer.py --save autodrive.rrd --no-spawn
```

The Rerun consumer uses a Rerun `MapView` and static map logs for the live
entities:

- `autodrive/position` — current machine position as a geospatial point
- `autodrive/anchorpoint` — current DSAP anchor as a geospatial point
- `autodrive/machine_line` — geospatial heading line starting at the machine position
- `autodrive/trail` — recent machine path, capped by `--trail-seconds` (default 1800 / 30 min)

---

## Bench setup (rehearse with no machine)

Do the whole sequence on a **virtual CAN** bus first — it behaves exactly like a
real one, and the included simulator plays the Display.

1. **Create the virtual bus** (once per boot):

   ```sh
   sudo modprobe vcan
   sudo ip link add dev vcan0 type vcan
   sudo ip link set up vcan0
   ```

2. **Start the fake Display** in its own terminal and leave it running:

   ```sh
   export CAN_BUS=vcan0
   ./simulator.py                 # plays the "line" route (= ./simulator.py vcan0 line)
   ./simulator.py vcan0 uturn     # for step 10's U-turn route
   ```

   It starts the virtual machine **at the route's start point** (so the loop
   closes), emits VP1/VDS/DSSTAT, acquires GPS PPP after a few seconds, computes
   an anchor when you activate, and drives the machine along the waypoints you
   stream. Pass the same route name the step is driving.

3. **Run the steps** in another terminal (`export CAN_BUS=vcan0` there too).

`candump vcan0` in a third terminal shows the raw traffic, exactly as on a real
bus.

---

## Real-machine setup

1. Bring up the real interface at the machine's bitrate (J1939 is usually
   **250 kbit/s**):

   ```sh
   sudo ip link set can0 type can bitrate 250000
   sudo ip link set can0 up
   export CAN_BUS=can0
   ```

   Do **not** run `simulator.py` — the machine's real Display provides the traffic.

2. `candump can0` in a second terminal to watch traffic independently.

3. Replace [`line.geojson`](line.geojson) / [`u_field.geojson`](u_field.geojson)
   with your **actual field** path (a GeoJSON `LineString` in WGS84 lon/lat). The
   datum and the inside-field box are derived from the route, so nothing else
   needs editing for the field location.

4. The AutoDrive **source address** is **29 (`0x1D`)** — confirmed as the "In
   Field Planner" by [`spec/spec2.md`](spec/spec2.md) and set in
   [`autodrive.py`](autodrive.py) (`SOURCE_AUTODRIVE`).

## The sequence

Each step: **what it proves → command → what you should see → ✅ PASS gate →
❌ if it fails.**

### Step 1 — Can we put a frame on the bus at all?

`01_basic_can.py` builds one ADJOB (systemActive=false) and transmits it.

```sh
./01_basic_can.py
```

You should see the id break down (priority 6 / pgn 0xFFCC / source 29) and one
`TX` line. In `candump` you should see exactly one `18FFCC1D` frame.

- ✅ **PASS:** the script exits cleanly **and** the frame shows up in `candump`.
- ❌ **FAIL:** `python-can missing` → wrong shell; `Network is down` → interface
  not up; frame never in `candump` → wrong `CAN_BUS`, bus not terminated (120 Ω
  each end on a real bus), or wrong bitrate.

**→ Only if the frame is on the wire, go to Step 2.**

### Step 2 — Is the Display talking to us?

`02_listen_raw.py` listens ~6 s and tallies frames by PGN.

```sh
./02_listen_raw.py
```

- ✅ **PASS:** a steady tally of **VP1** (~10/s), **VDS** (~5/s) and **DSSTAT**
  (~5/s). (On the bench, that means `simulator.py` is running.)
- ❌ **FAIL:** zero frames → wrong bus/bitrate, or the Display/simulator isn't
  running. Only some PGNs → note which; a later step that needs it will fail too.

**→ Only if VP1 + VDS + DSSTAT are arriving, go to Step 3.**

### Step 3 — Is the GPS position correct?

`03_get_location.py` decodes VP1/VDS and prints lat/lon/heading/speed.

```sh
./03_get_location.py
```

Early lines may read **"no fix yet"** while PPP is acquired — normal.

- ✅ **PASS:** lat/lon resolve to your **actual position** (cross-check a phone
  GPS, agree within tens of metres); speed/heading sane when moving.
- ❌ **FAIL:** wildly wrong position → lat/lon decode offset or VP1 PGN; stuck at
  "no fix" → no PPP yet, or VP1 reporting `0xFFFFFFFF`.

**→ Only if the position is right, go to Step 4.**

### Step 4 — Are the gate bits readable and true?

`04_read_status.py` decodes DSSTAT. The two that matter are **GPS PPP available**
and **AutoDrive allowed** (the latter is operator-enabled on the display).

```sh
./04_read_status.py
```

- ✅ **PASS:** both `PPP=Y` **and** `allowed=Y` (have the operator enable field
  mode + AutoDrive option); other bits decode without garbage.
- ❌ **FAIL:** `allowed` never Y even when enabled → you're masking a 2-bit J1939
  field with a single bit (PROTOCOL.md §5.1). The decode here is corrected; if it
  still misreads, the bit positions differ from the proposal — ask the vendor.

**→ Only if PPP and allowed both read Y on demand, go to Step 5.**

### Step 5 — Does the Display accept our heartbeat?

`05_send_adjob.py` transmits ADJOB at 1 Hz with **systemActive=off**.

```sh
./05_send_adjob.py
```

- ✅ **PASS:** ADJOB once per second (`byte2=0x00`), and the **display recognises
  an AutoDrive node** (check its UI). No bus errors.
- ❌ **FAIL:** display ignores us → wrong source address (should be `29`/`0x1D`) or PGN.

**→ Only if the display sees us, go to Step 6.**

### Step 6 — Can we start a job and get an anchor?

`06_activate_and_anchor.py` runs the activation gate (PPP + AutoDrive allowed +
inside field + route loaded), sends **ADJOB systemActive=true** with a fresh job
ID (RunCommand still OFF), and waits for the Display to broadcast a **DSAP
anchor**.

> Set `line.geojson` / `u_field.geojson` to your real field path and place the
> machine inside the route's field box. For diagnostics only, `print_dsap_anchor.py`
> has `--no-inside-gate`; normal job requests should keep the inside-field gate on.

```sh
./06_activate_and_anchor.py
```

For a direct anchor-only check, `print_dsap_anchor.py` now also sends ADJOB first
by default:

```sh
./print_dsap_anchor.py
./print_dsap_anchor.py --route uturn
./print_dsap_anchor.py --passive   # listen only, do not request a job
```

- ✅ **PASS:** `✓ anchor received` near the field. Machine has **not moved**.
- ❌ **FAIL:** `inside=-` forever → wrong field polygon/datum or machine outside;
  active on but no anchor → Display didn't start a job (already in one? rejecting
  our systemActive?).

**→ Only once you reliably get an anchor, go to Step 7.**

### Step 7 — Are our waypoint coordinates correct? (offline)

`07_coordinates.py` needs **no bus**. It loads the real `u_field.geojson` route,
converts it to anchor-relative cm, packs every point to ADWPI, and decodes it back.

```sh
./07_coordinates.py
```

- ✅ **PASS:** every point round-trips exactly, magnitudes within the ADWPI range
  (≈ −2.5 km … +8 km of the anchor — PROTOCOL.md §5.2).
- ❌ **FAIL:** offsets beyond range → anchor too far from field (the `−250000 cm`
  offset question).

**→ Once the packing checks out, go to Step 8.**

### Step 8 — Does the line appear on the Display in the right place?

`08_stream_waypoints.py` activates, takes the anchor, and **streams the first
100-point window** (3-point overlap, 10 ms pacing). The machine does **not** move.

```sh
./08_stream_waypoints.py
```

Watch the **display's map**.

- ✅ **PASS:** a line appears **at the correct location and orientation**; ~100
  ADWPI frames over ~1 s.
- ❌ **FAIL:** line mirrored/rotated/offset → east/north **sign** error or
  datum/anchor mismatch. Fix it here — a wrong line here is a wrong line under the
  wheels at step 9. No line at all → Display not accepting ADWPI, or never got
  systemActive/anchor.

**→ Only when the line is drawn correctly, go to Step 9.**

### Step 9 — Run and track (⚠️ THE MACHINE STEERS; YOU DRIVE)

> **STOP.** Area clear. E-stop in hand. Second person watching. **Flying start:**
> park ~5 m before the line's start point and drive straight at it, then activate
> AutoDrive as you reach the point (the AgJunction can't engage from a standstill).

`09_run_and_track.py` runs the full loop on a straight test line: activate →
stream first window → raise **RunCommand** → track progress from GPS and re-stream
the window as the machine advances. **The RunCommand does not move the machine** —
you push the joystick forward yourself (1–2 kph); once on the line AutoDrive
engages and handles the steering. On the bench the simulator drives for you.

```sh
./09_run_and_track.py
```

- ✅ **PASS:** with you driving forward, AutoDrive follows the line, `engaged=Y`,
  progress climbs to the end, **no reject code** (DSSTAT reject reason stays 0).
- ❌ **FAIL / ABORT:** doesn't engage + a **reject reason** → read it (PROTOCOL.md
  §9); reset RunCommand and retry. Steers wrong / off the line → **e-stop now**,
  it's the sign/orientation bug from step 8.

**→ Only once it tracks a straight line cleanly, go to Step 10.**

### Step 10 — Full run, with a turn

`10_full_run.py` runs the identical loop on a complete route. Pick it at the top:

```python
ROUTE = "uturn"     # "line" | "uturn"
```

`uturn` is the `u_field.geojson` path — two legs joined by a **headland turn** —
which exercises the headland flag (`[H]` in the progress line) and a real curve,
the realistic "next swath" case. On the bench, start the simulator on the same
route: `./simulator.py vcan0 uturn`.

```sh
./10_full_run.py
```

- ✅ **PASS:** with you driving forward, AutoDrive follows the whole route
  including the turn, the headland flag shows over the curve, progress tracked,
  no reject codes.
- ❌ **FAIL:** same diagnosis as step 9. Curves were *rough* in earlier field
  tests — drive **slowly** (1–2 kph) and consider turning the steering PID up. If
  the curve loses steering, the turn may be too sharp; the proposal wants gentle
  curves and ≤30°/segment (PROTOCOL.md
  §8.5).

`LOOP_TIMEOUT_S` is a bench auto-stop; set it to `None` for an unbounded run.

## Vendor questions

**Resolved by the field checklist ([`spec/spec2.md`](spec/spec2.md)):**

- AutoDrive **source address** is **29 (`0x1D`)** — the "In Field Planner". The
  display is **40 (`0x28`)**. (`SOURCE_AUTODRIVE` / `SOURCE_DISPLAY`.)
- ADWPI coordinate **offset is −250000 cm** — the spec sheet's earlier −25000 was
  an error. (The "25 km" gloss is loose; −250000 cm is 2.5 km.)
- **RunCommand does nothing yet** — the machine is driven manually; AutoDrive only
  steers. The display also ignores us until waypoint streaming pauses (~1 s), at
  which point it (re)builds the line.

**Still open:**

- Which value of DSSTAT **Current Direction** means *reverse*.
- Exact bit positions of the ADWPI byte-8 flags.
